Kid:s App
=========

Kid:s App is made with the use of phonegap and cordova.js, it is a so called webapp.
The application has one mobile-client and also a server-side with a mysql-database setup.

The application will work like this...
--------------------------------------
The kid draws a picture on a real paper, he can then take a photo of this picture and post it to the application, 
The picture will then get sent to one of the volonteers who gives feedbacks to the user that did draw the picture, finally the user will get a feedback posted back to him or her.
This will then spark confidence to the user kid, making him or her want to draw or do more stuff and to trust his or hers creative side!

![This is a student project.](/hyper_island-student_project_white.jpg)

Our idea is to improve the school-system for children in the ages between 6-11.
We want the kids to have a better school-system where they can teach together and also each others, we want to turn the school to a nice &amp; fun place where the kids can exchange ideas and keep their creativity!
